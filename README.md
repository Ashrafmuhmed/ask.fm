## Ask.fm Clone - A C++ Social Q&A Platform

A command-line social Q&A application inspired by Ask.fm, built with C++ and STL. The platform enables users to interact through anonymous and non-anonymous questions, featuring:

• User authentication and profile management

• Threaded conversations with parent-child question relationships

• Real-time feed of questions and answers

• File-based data persistence

• Privacy controls for anonymous questions

• Unique ID generation system

The project demonstrates practical implementation of data structures, object-oriented programming, and system design principles while creating an engaging social platform.
